# Code Coverage and Reporting

Unit tests help to ensure functionality, and provide a means of verification for refactoring efforts. Code coverage is a measurement of the amount of code that is run by unit tests - either lines, branches, or methods. As an example, if you have a simple application with only two conditional branches of code (branch a, and branch b), a unit test that verifies conditional branch a will report branch code coverage of 50%.
